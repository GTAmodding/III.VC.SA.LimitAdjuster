;
;
; ### Buildings
;     Buildings on the building pool
;     Building is anything placed by a IPL that is not a object (see Dummys or Objects to see what is a object)
;
; ### Peds
;     Peds on the peds pool
;     Note this does not increase the amount of peds roaming, but increases the maximum number of peds can be created
;
; ### Vehicles
;    Vehicles on the vehicles pool
;    Note this does not increase the amount of vehicles roaming, but increases the maximum number of vehicles can be created
;
; ### Objects
;    Dynamic objects (i.e. registed in objects.dat) near/visible to the player
;    See also: Dummys
;
; ### Dummys
;    Dynamic objects (i.e. registed in objects.dat) spawned at once in the entire world
;    Whenever the player is near this dynamic object an actual Object representation of it is created (see also Objects)
;    
;    This is used to save memory, this stores basic information about the dyn object (position, model, etc) and only spawns
;    the actual dynamic stuff (which uses more memory) when necessary, that's, when near it.
;
; ### PedIntelligence
;    Ped AI instances
;    **MUST** be the same value as Peds
;
; ### ColModel [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Collision models loaded at once
;    Notice this is not the same as one .col file, .col files might be collision archives which contain many ColModels.
;
; ### PtrNodeSingle [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Nodes for the pool of singly linked lists
;    Directly related to the amount of entities spawned in the world and values stored in quad trees.
;
; ### PtrNodeDouble [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Nodes for the pool of double linked lists
;    Directly related to the amount of entities spawned in the world
;
; ### PtrNode
;    Mix of PtrNodeSingle and PtrNodeDouble (see PtrNodeSingle and PtrNodeDouble)
;
; ### EntryInfoNode [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Directly related to the amount of collidable entities spawned in the world
;
; ### Task [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Running pedestrian tasks around the world
;
; ### Event [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Events notification around the world (vehicles collided, etc)
;
; ### PointRoute [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Related to AI routes (see scm command 05D7)
;
; ### PatrolRoute [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Related to AI patrol routes (see scm command 0755)
;
; ### NodeRoute [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Related to dynamic AI routes to go somewhere (for example, the command 05F5)
;
; ### TaskAllocator [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Allocator of tasks to organized group of peds
;
; ### PedAttractors [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Peds attracted to specific objects (e.g. ped using a cassino machine)
;
; ### Treadables
;    Animated buildings?
;
; ### AudioScriptObj
;    Script sounds (see scm command 018D)
;
;
; ### MatrixList [CanBeUnlimited]
;    Pool of transformation matrices, directly related to the amount of physical objects in the world
;
; ### AlphaEntityList
;    ?
;
; ### InVisibleEntityPtrs
;    ?
;
; ### VisibleEntityPtrs
;    ?
;
; ### OutsideWorldWaterBlocks
;    Amount of blocks outside the world boundaries to be rendered 
;    Fixes water flickering outside world bondaries
;
; ### StreamingObjectInstancesList
;    List of streamed in entities RwObjects (dff models)
;    Fixes buildings flickering when seeing too many of them
;
; ### TimeModels
;    Maximum amount of timed object entries (http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=TOBJ)
